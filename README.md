pyronbee
============

This repository contains my own implementation of the IronBee WAF Research
project data. For more information, please fetch the whitepaper from
https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2012/07/25/protocol-level-
evasion-of-web-application-firewalls

The current version of pyronbee does not have test cases, but will be added
soon. Also, momentarily supports basic detection to responses, something that
will be added on the next release.
